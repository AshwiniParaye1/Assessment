# Vite App
This is a basic Vite application that serves as a starting point for building web applications using React. It includes essential files and configurations to help you get up and running quickly.



## Overview
This repository contains a React code that fetches data from an API using Axios and displays it as a tree structure. It provides functionality to toggle the display of errors and child spans. This README file provides an overview of the code and instructions for setting up and running the application.



## Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure that you have the following software installed:

* Node.js: Download and install Node.js
* npm (Node Package Manager): Installed automatically with Node.js
